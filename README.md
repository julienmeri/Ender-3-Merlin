# Ender-3-Merlin
Hey there !

here is all the configuration files, and all the modification I used on my ender 3 3Dprinter !

First of all, I changed my mainboard card, for a Cheetah V1.1.b, which has a 32bit arm vore, and 4 TMC2209 stepdriver.
I've printed a lot with this card, without any changes about firmware, but, at the end, i've ordering a BLtouch, and update the firmware.

Then, i've read a lot about octoprint, and tried to make a cheaper verion of it with an esp32, and the github projet of luc-github :
link 1 : https://github.com/luc-github/ESP3D
link 2 : https://github.com/luc-github/ESP3D-WEBUI

and i'm still developping this mutation on my 3D printer.
